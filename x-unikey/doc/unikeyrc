# Unikey XIM config file

# AutoSave: Yes|No
# If AutoSave=Yes, unikey will save options on exit
# Be careful when editing this file while unikey is running with AutoSave enabled
#   Upon exit unikey will overwrite your settings. To avoid that, tell unikey
#   to reload config file when you finish editing. See unikey manual
# AutoSave is useful if you want unikey to remember its window position
AutoSave = Yes

# Initial state: On|Off
InitState = ON

# Input methods: TELEX|VNI|VIQR|VIQR*
Input = TELEX

# Output charsets: UNICODE|TCVN|VNI|VIQR
Charset = UNICODE

# FreeStyle: Yes|No
# "Yes" means you can type hook, breve marks at the end of words
# TELEX users should use "No", VNI users should use "Yes"
FreeStyle = No

# ToneManual: Yes|No
# You should set this to "No" to let Unikey determine position for tone marks.
ToneManual = No

# ModernStyle: Yes|No
# "Yes" means "hoa', khoe?" style, "No" means "ho'a, kho?e" style
ModernStyle = No

# XvnkbSync: Yes|No
# Set to "Yes" to synchronize unikey-gtk with xvnkb GUI
# This applies only to unikey-gtk module, not XIM server (ukxim)
# To synchronize ukxim with xvnkb GUI, see doc/manual
XvnkbSync = No

# Bell: Yes|No
# Turn on/off bell notification when key shortcuts are pressed
Bell = Yes

# CommitMethod: Send|Forward|Mixed. Default: Send
#   Use XSendEvent or XIM forward key event to commit string
# Both methods will work with most applications.
# Some application with high-level security may
#   block XSendEvent, so CommitMethod must be set to "Forward"
# Some versions of xterm are known to work only if CommitMethod=Send
#   see doc/manual for information on xterm
# I recommend "Send" first. If it does not work, try "Forward"
CommitMethod = Send

# XimFlow = Static|Dynamic. Default: Static
# You should always use Static. If something does not work,
#   then try Dynamic. Rxvt-unicode is known to work only with Dynamic mode.
# Before changing this option, make sure unikey is not loaded in memory.
XimFlow = Static

# Macrofile: path to macro file
# To enable macro, specify the path to your macro file.
# For example: MacroFile = ~/ukmacro
#MacroFile = ~/ukmacro

# PosX: X Position of unikey window
# set a minus value to let unikey use the default position
PosX = 1200

# PosY: Y Position of unikey window
# set a minus value to let unikey use the default position
