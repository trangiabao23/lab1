For users of version 0.9.2 and older, take note of some changes since
version 1.0:

- Config file is changed from ~/.unikeyrc to ~/.unikey/options. Other
files, such as macro, user-define input method should be put in
~/.unikey folder.

- From this version, you can define your own input method. See 4.6 in
the Manual.

- To restore a sequence of key strokes (that has been processed as
Vietnamese), press: CTRL-SHIFT-ESC.

Some options are removed since version 1.0:
- FreeMarking: Now it's always on.
- ManualTone: Who needs it anymore ? ;)

---------------

The unikey engine has been totally rewritten for version 1.0. You will
find out many new features as you use it, especially how unikey
recoginises non-vietnamese sequences to NOT process them as
vietnamese. As a result, telex users can type many english words
without having to switch back and forth between vietnamese and
non-vietnamese modes, or double-type conflicting characters. (VNI
users can also benefit, but not as much as TELEX users).

For example: now you can type 'linux', 'changes' normally, you don't have
to type 'linuxx' or 'changess'.

This feature also helps you recognise typing mistakes as you
type. When you see unikey refuses to put a tone mark (that you think
it should), you know the word is not vietnamese correct.

There is a side effect, however. Now it's NOT easy to to type
incorrect vietnamese sequences such as abbreviations: HDDQT (Hoi DDo^`ng
Qua?n Tri), BDD (Bo'ng DDa'). To type those sequences, you need to
start the word by hitting CTRL-SHIFT-Z. Doing so will temporarily
disable unikey's spell-check, therefore enables typing incorrect
vietnamese sequences (such as abbreviations above). When you type a
new word, unikey will be back to the normal processing mode.
