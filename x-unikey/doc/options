#   to reload config file when you finish editing. See unikey manual
# AutoSave is useful if you want unikey to remember its window position
AutoSave = Yes

# Initial state: On|Off
InitState = OFF

# Input: TELEX|VNI|VIQR|USER
# Input method. If you specify input=USER, you must also specify UsrKeyMapFile
Input = TELEX

# Output charsets: UNICODE|TCVN|VNI|VIQR
Charset = UNICODE

# FreeStyle: Yes|No
#  "Yes" means you can type hook, breve marks anywhere after the base character
#  not necessarily right after the base.

# CommitMethod: Send|Forward|Mixed. Default: Send
#   Use XSendEvent or XIM forward key event to commit string

# Some versions of xterm are known to work only if CommitMethod=Send
#   see doc/manual for information on xterm
# I recommend "Send" first. If it does not work, try "Forward"
CommitMethod = Send

# XimFlow = Static|Dynamic. Default: Static
# You should always use Static. If something does not work,
